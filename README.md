JLE(JAX Like Engine)

If you are familiar with JAX, and you are not interested in learning about the internals, please continue to use JAX as JAX is one of the best ML library existing. 

I,Suresh Neethimohan, building this small library to understand the internals and use it for my own AI research purposes as I hate abstractions.

You are welcome to build along with me. Just mail me at mohansuresh333@gmail.com to discuss more. 

Thanks for checking out this github library. 

Have a good day.
